This is China province, city and county Linkage demo. It will show the linkage result after opening the demo.html.

Note:
if you are using Google Chrome browser, after double clicking(show as file:// URL) the demo.html, suppose you will NOT get the expected result and see below error message in you control console.
and i think you would get expected result if using FireFox , IE or other browser. 
"Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin."

Fix:
That solved the problem by no longer trying to perform a CORS(Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) request from a file:// URL.
you can put this demo in server and try Http, suppose you can get expected result, enjoy it, thanks.
